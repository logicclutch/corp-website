\`\`\`

2. **"Domain not verified"**
   - Check DNS records are correctly added
   - Wait up to 48 hours for DNS propagation
   - Use [DNS checker tools](https://dnschecker.org) to verify

3. **"403 Forbidden"**
   - Domain verification incomplete
   - API key doesn't have sending permissions

4. **"422 Validation Error"**
   - Check email addresses are valid
   - Ensure "from" address uses your verified domain

### Debug Steps:
1. Check `/api/contact/verify` endpoint
2. Review Vercel function logs
3. Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
4. Verify DNS records are properly set

## 8. Domain Verification Status

You can send emails immediately using Resend's sandbox domain, but for production:

### Before Domain Verification:
- Emails sent from: `onboarding@resend.dev`
- Limited to verified email addresses
- "Via resend.dev" in email headers

### After Domain Verification:
- Emails sent from: `noreply@logicclutch.com`
- Can send to any email address
- Professional appearance

## 9. Alternative: Quick Start (Sandbox)

If you want to test immediately without domain setup:

1. **Skip domain verification** for now
2. **Add your email** to verified addresses in Resend dashboard
3. **Test with your own email** first
4. **Set up domain later** for production

This way you can test the functionality immediately while DNS propagates.
